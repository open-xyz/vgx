## Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. Hardcoded credentials are a security vulnerability that can lead to sensitive data exposure.

- **File**: examples/vulnerable.js
- **Severity**: high
- **Line**: 10

**Recommendation**: Avoid hardcoding credentials in your code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system to handle credentials.

### 2. SQL Injection vulnerability due to the direct injection of user input into a SQL query.

- **File**: examples/vulnerable.js
- **Severity**: critical
- **Line**: 19

**Recommendation**: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### 3. Path traversal vulnerability due to the direct use of user input in file paths.

- **File**: examples/vulnerable.js
- **Severity**: high
- **Line**: 30

**Recommendation**: Validate and sanitize user input before using it in file paths. Consider using a library to safely resolve paths.

### 4. Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the direct injection of user input into HTML output.

- **File**: examples/vulnerable.js
- **Severity**: high
- **Line**: 42

**Recommendation**: Use output encoding libraries to safely encode user input before including it in HTML output.

### 5. Weak encryption implementation due to the use of a static initialization vector.

- **File**: examples/vulnerable.js
- **Severity**: medium
- **Line**: 52

**Recommendation**: Use a unique initialization vector for each encryption operation. Consider using a library that handles this automatically.

### 6. Command injection vulnerability due to the direct use of user input in a system command.

- **File**: examples/vulnerable.js
- **Severity**: critical
- **Line**: 66

**Recommendation**: Validate and sanitize user input before using it in system commands. Consider using a library that provides a safe API for executing system commands.

### 7. Insecure cookie setting due to the lack of the secure and HttpOnly flags.

- **File**: examples/vulnerable.js
- **Severity**: medium
- **Line**: 76

**Recommendation**: Set the secure flag to ensure the cookie is only sent over HTTPS. Set the HttpOnly flag to prevent the cookie from being accessed by client-side scripts.
